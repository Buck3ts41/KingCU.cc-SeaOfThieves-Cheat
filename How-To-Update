The main thing that you will need to update in order to the cheat to work, are the offsets.
To update the offsets you need to search on-line for the latest sea of thieves SDK.
After you found that, put the SDK folder inside the UPDATE folder of the cheat, then run the 
OffsetsFinder.
Once you do that, a new file called Offsets should appear.
Now come the boring part, you need to replace all the values from the cheat offsets file,
to the new values that you found with offsetsfinder.
Once you do that, just recompile and it should work.
